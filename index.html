   <p>Lisa Left Eye Lopes came into the spotlight with the popularity of TLC. A group to this day is the only girl group to go platnium, the number one girl group in American, and number two to the Spice Girls Worldwide. Without any of the members TLC would not have the legacy it has today. An Important part of that legacy is Left Eye. As the rapper of the group she wrote all her parts, but she was not only the rapper of the groups she many times seems to be the visual artist of the group. Something a lot of people may not know. Chilli and T-boz themselves said that she designed all the stage set-up for their concerts. While many only know her TLC, she released an amazing solo album. Unfortunately her record company did not release "Supernova" in the US(meaning it isn't avaliable for streaming to this day in the US). I would describe this album as a experimental(for the early 2000s) and a bit eclectic. Before her passing she was working on releasing her second solo album. </p>

    <p>Before her passing she shared her vision of opening a youth center in Honduras with her famliy. Although her life ended suddenly and tragically, her vision came true posthumously. After her passing her family started the Lisa Lopes foundation, which gives youth in need with resources to help them. During her time here there were many literacy programs in Honduras she promoted. Locally, she opened up an affordable recording studio for the people in her community. She also mentored young budding artists. After winner "Who wants to be a millionaire" she donated her winnings to "The Village Foundation" charity. </p>
